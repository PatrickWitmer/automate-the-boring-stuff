1. Create 35 different quizes
2. Create 50 multiple-choice questions for each quiz, in random order
3. Provides the correct answer and three random wrong answers for each question, in random order
4. Writes the quizzes to 35 text files
5. Wrires the answer keys to 35 text files

This means the code will need to do the following:

1. Store the states and their capitals in a dictionary
2. Call open(), write(), and close() for the quiz and answer key text files.
3 Use random,.shuffle() to randomize the order of the questions and multiple-choice options
